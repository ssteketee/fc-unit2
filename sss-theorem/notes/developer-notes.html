What is SSS?		<p>Does this activity need to start with a review of the relationship between reflection and perpendicular bisectors? (If `m` is the perpendicular bisector of segment `AB`, it's the mirror that reflects `A` to `B`, and a third point `C` is equally distant from `A` and `B` iff it lies on `m`.)</p>
