Handedness
	<p>You can connect the term handedness to the clockwise and counter-clockwise terminology by asking students to hold their right hands with the thumb up, ask whether their fingers curl clockwise or counter-clockwise, and then ask them to do the same thing with their left hands. In this way, they can identify clockwise as corresponding "left-handed" and counter-clockwise as corresponding to "right-handed."</p>
	<p>In the discussion concluding this activity, ask students, "What if we had a triangle without the variable `x` traveling around it? How could we decide whether it’s right- or left-handed then?" Assuming some students respond that handedness should then be determined by the alphabetical order of the labels of the vertices, ask whether this solves the problem, presumably spurring other students to ask "What if there aren’t any labels?" Aim for students to realize that these labels are somewhat arbitrary, and that the important part is whether the domain and range have the same handedness or opposite handedness: their conclusions about whether a particular transformation preserves or reverses handedness are correct no matter what vocabulary is used to describe the specific triangles they worked with.</p>
	<p>[The noun <em>chirality</em> and the adjectives <em>chiral</em> and <em>achiral</em> are related to handedness. An object that can be distinguished from its mirror image (such as a hand or a scalene triangle) is chiral, and has chirality. An object identical to its mirror image (such as a baseball or an unlabeled isosceles triangle) is achiral, and lacks chirality.]</p>

	<p>Page 1 is relatively straightforward. If students look carefully at the relationship between the original `triABC` and the doubly-reflected `triA''B''C''`, they can likely identify the single transformation to use, which they can then adjust to produce an image that matches `triA''B''C''`.</p>
	<p>Page 2 is harder, though students can probably identify the most likely function to try if they remember the results of their investigation of handedness.</p>
	<p>Page 3 is a challenge, and might be easier for students to approach by if you suggest that they reason backward from the most likely solution.</p>
