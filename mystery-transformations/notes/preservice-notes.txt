	<p>The Mystery Transformations task was designed to assist students in understanding the differences between reflections, rotations, translations, and dilations by focusing on how a pre-image and image point behave when a point is dragged. A focus on behaviors of transformations contributes to a deeper understanding of properties of geometric transformations. Students can investigate fixed points, relative speeds, and directions of pre-image and image points by dragging. This task is supported by the dynamic geometry technology, Web Sketchpad. Tools such as GeoGebra, Cabri, or The Geometer's Sketchpad could also be used.<p>
    <p> You can try the task for yourself <a href="http://fi-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/tmt/unit_3/MysteryTransformationsPoints/index.html">here</a>br/><p><br>
    <p> In the following video, you can observe two students, Nagi and Wes, solve the Mystery Transformations Task. Notice how they focus on the behaviors of the points to identify the geometric transformations. Note: Nagi is seated on the left and Wes is seated on the right.<p>

    <p class="question">Q1. What do you think Nagi means by "staying with it"? (0:16)<p>
    <p class="question">Q2. What follow up questions might you ask Nagi to probe his thinking further on the translation?<p>
    <p class="question">Q3. Nagi seemed sure it was a rotation, but while talking to Wes he talked himself out of it. (1:34) What was his missing knowledge about rotations that led to this uncertainty? What would you ask or do (or not do!) to help solidify Nagi’s ideas?  Do you think they would have similar confusion for rotations of any degree?  Later he resolves the idea himself and settles back to the rotation.  How might you further challenge his thoughts to see how well he understands the difference?<p>
    <p class="question">Q4. How could you address Wes’s comment about reflecting over K? (2:35)  Do you think Nagi convinced him?<p>
    <p class="question">Q5. Nagi correctly identified a dilation but claimed he didn’t know what it was.  What further might you want to offer him to help them understand dilations better? (2:52)<p>
    <p class="question">Q6. (4:03) Wes used the phrase “fixed point” when he probably meant “fixed distance,” based on his next few comments.  The phrase fixed point has a very particular meaning in the context of geometric transformations, do you think it would be important to address this misuse of language?  If so, how?<p>
    <p class="question">Q7. In what ways did Wes and Nagi draw upon rate of change to differentiate the geometric transformations that were applied to the points?<p>
    <p class="question">Q8. How did Wes and Nagi's understandings of geometric transformations evolve as they worked through the activity?<p>
