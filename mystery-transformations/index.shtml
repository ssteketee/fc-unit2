        <p>These five pages are similar to the warmup, but you have several extra tools available. You can use these tools to find shortcuts that make it easy to solve superposition problems. For instance, you might invent a shortcut for finding the mirror for a reflect function, or a shortcut for finding the center point for a dilate function.</p>

      <p><strong>Activity 1 (Warmup):</strong> Each page has a different function-family tool with which you superposed an image of `triABC` on `triDEF.`</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="pencil">For which function families did you achieve the goal?</li>
        <li class="pencil">Which success was hardest? How did you overcome the difficulty?</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Activity 2 (Discover Shortcuts):</strong> Each page has a function-family tool and three construction tools. With the construction tools you invented an easier way to superpose an image of `triABC` on `triDEF.`</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="pencil">For which functions did you invent a shortcut?</li>
        <li class="pencil">Which shortcut did you like the most? Why?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Activity 3 (Choose the Function):</strong> Each page has five function-family tools and three construction tools. By identifying the right family and using a shortcut, you superposed an image of `triABC` on `triDEF.`</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="pencil">Which family was easiest to identify? Why?</li>
        <li class="pencil">Which family was hardest to identify? Why?</li>
        <li class="pencil">How did your shortcut discoveries help you identify the right family?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Activity 4 (Match the Domain and Range):</strong> Each page has all eight tools, but the function tools only transform points. You identified the family, restricted `x` to `triABC,` and superposed the range on `triDEF.`</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="pencil">Can you construct the same superposition with point tools as with triangle tools? Which is easier? Why?</li>
        <li class="pencil">For which family did the variables move at different speeds?</li>
        <li class="pencil">How is variable speed connected to whether a function is an isometry or a similarity?</li>
