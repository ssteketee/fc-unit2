Orientation
	<p>Here I tried to emphasize the orientation of variable x rather than of the triangle. Advantage: it goes back to the fundamentals of the independent and dependent variables. Disadvantage: there are six points to match up. To resolve that we make A, B, C (and x?) auto-matches.
  This sketch has four pages, each corresponding to a transformation. Students are given a triangle ABC and perform the indicated transformation. Does the transformation preserve the triangle's orientation? Experiment with adjusting the mirror line, the angle of rotation, etc. to be sure.
	<strong>Labeling Issue:</strong> The glide reflection image labels show a double prime instead of a single prime. See <a href="https://geometricfunctions.com/forge-math-connections/index.php?title=WSP_Coding:Labeling_Improvements">the wiki page</a> for more info. Here, because the glide-reflect givens are assumed, we modify the glide reflect tool so that the intermediate (hidden) objects are labeled A, B, and C (so that the final showing objects are A', B', and C'). In general, when the tool doesn't assume A, B, and C, there's a big risk: if the student doesn't match up the A, B, and C of the tool with the given A, B, and C in the sketch, the labels generated by the tool will be out of sync with the labels of the glide-reflect pre-image points.</p>
	<p> (Daniel)Italicize A, B, and C in the last paragraph on page 1 of the websketch.</p> 
	<p>Change F to F' in the last sentence on page 2 of the websketch.</p>
	<p>Add a space between the first two sentences on page 5 of the websketch.</p>
	
Explore Multiple Reflections
<p>Sketch 2 (not yet built) will include the following tools: reflection, rotation, translation, glide reflection, angle measurement, and segment with length tool. On page 1, students are given a triangle ABC and asked to reflect it twice. Is its orientation preserved? Which single transformation is equivalent to the two reflections? Check by starting again with triangle ABC and performing (presumably) a rotation. Students will likely observe that their two mirror lines intersect at the center of rotation. They can use the angle measurement tool to find the angle of rotation and compare it to the angle formed by the intersecting mirror lines. On page 2 of the sketch, students are again asked to reflect triangle ABC twice. Can they arrange the mirror lines to create something other than a rotation? Translate triangle ABC to show the equivalence. Use the angle measurement tool and the segment with length tool to determine the relationship between the two mirror lines and the translation vector. On page 3, the same setup as before, but now students reflect three times.</p>
<p>The Rotate tool should come with an angle slider.</p>
<p>The Angle tool shows calculations that should be hidden from view.</p>
<p>This quickly becomes a very crowded sketch, which worries me. Makes me wonder whether the transformation tools should show the triangle vertices connected with segments so that it's clearer what's being matched. Perhaps, too, we should include the Visibility wdiget and suggest that students hide A'B'C' after constructing A"B"C".</p>

Construct Multiple Reflections
	<p>Need to add the angle bisector tool.</p>
	<p>Also the directions on each page should be headlined with "Construct this Reflect Function", "Construct this
	Rotate Function", etc.</p>
	<p>Should the reflect function include a variable x to animate around each domain?</p>
	<p>I'm torn about including the variable x. Given the focus earlier on orientation, there's a good reason to do it, but it adds more clutter to the sketch and the tools. By this third sketch, having experimented in sketch 2 with these same ideas, I'm inclined to say no.</p>
	<p>The Reflect tool should fire the Animate Reflection button when it finishes.</p>
